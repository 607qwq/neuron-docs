This document mainly introduces some parameter configuration and point information configuration specifications for northbound applications and southbound drives.

---

## Common Address Format Option

Common options supported by each driver's address format.

```

---

## MQTT

The data collected from the device can be transmitted to the mqtt broker through mqtt application, and instructions can be sent to neuron throuth mqtt application.

---

### Parameter Setting

**client-id** is mqtt client id.

**ssl** enable mqtt ssl, default false.

**host** is mqtt broker host.

### Parameter Setting

**connection mode**: The way the driver connects to the device, the default is client, which means that the neuron driver is used as the client.

**host**ï¼šWhen neuron is used as a client, host means the ip of the remote device. When used as a server, it means the ip used by neuron locally, and 0.0.0.0 can be filled in by default.

**port**:  When neuron is used as client, port means the tcp port of the remote device. When used as a server, it means the tcp port used by neuron locally. default 502.

#### **example**

```

    1!00007
    1!10001
    1!10005
    1!30004.0
    1!40010.4
    1!40001.15

int16/uint16:
    1!30004(default #L)
    1!30004#B
    1!30004#L
    1!40004(default #L)
    1!40004#L
    1!40004#B

int32/uint32/float:
    1!30004(default #LL)
    1!30004#BB
    1!30004#LB
    1!30004#BL
    1!30004#LL
    1!40004(default #LL)
    1!40004#LB
    1!40004#BB
    1!40004#LL
    1!40004#BL

string:
    1!30001.10(default H)
    1!30001.10H
    1!30001.10L
    1!40001.10(default H)
    1!40001.10H
    1!40001.10L
```

**!** Some device documents use function and register addresses to describe instructions. First, determine the highest digit of the address according to function. And add 1 to the register address to be the address used by neuron.

example: function is 0x3, and register address is 0, then address used by neuron is 400001.
