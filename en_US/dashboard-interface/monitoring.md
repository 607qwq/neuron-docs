## Data Monitoring

This interface displays the monitoring status of the data. Users can pull down the dropdown box of device and group, selecting the device and the group to view according to their needs. (Generally, a group can be understood as a certain type of sensor connected under the device, such as a temperature sensor. Of course, users can also define groups according to their own needs).

The interface displays the update time of the data, all the tag information under the group, selected by the user, including the name of each tag, the driver address, the value and whether the write operation is possible, as shown in the following figure.
